    "<p>Observing the tokens commonly occurring most in BECOMING and the rank of BECOMING, it seems like \"family\" is a keyword that is the most commonly occurring word in January and May/June in which BECOMING reached its highest rank as best seller in 2020.<br>Another interesting observation is that the keyword \"balanced\" occurs as the most unique word to BECOMING in contrast to other books within the weeks within January, May/June, and September where BECOMING ranks highest as best seller of 2020, too.<br>Therefore, it seems as though a mixture of ingredients between commonly discussed and relevant topics and unique topics such as family in general and the focus of balancing that of family and life comprise the attributes of BECOMING as a best seller of 2020.</p> "

The point that is being is observed is that these tokens behave as attributes in association to the rank of the book from a glance.</p>"
