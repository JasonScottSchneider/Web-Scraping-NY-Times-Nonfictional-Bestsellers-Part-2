# Web-Scraping-NY-Times-Nonfictional-Bestsellers-Part-2
This code applies some corpus linguistic methods and NLP methods to analyze the synopsis for each book that makes the list on the NY Times website for best sellers in 2020. Python and Jupyter Notebook are used in conjunction with Pandas and Seaborn. Part 2 unpickles the data so that linguistic analyses can be done over the synopsis for each book. Some wrangling of textual data is done. Then the TF-IDF is used to calculate scores for content words that measure how unique and common across a collected corpus. This analysis is in no way exhaustive but serves merely as a snapshot of an analysis over textual data that has been web scraped from the NY Times web page for best sellers of nonfictional books.
